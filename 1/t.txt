Aim: To implement inferencing with Bayesian Network.
Theory:
A Bayesian Network (also called a Bayes Net or Belief Network) is a probabilistic graphical model that
represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Inferencing (or inference) means calculating the probability of one or more variables, given the known
values of others (called evidence).

Key Features:
Nodes = Random variables (e.g., Weather, Traffic, Alarm).
Edges = Direct dependencies between variables.
Each node has a Conditional Probability Table (CPT) that defines the probability of each state of the node,
given the states of its parent nodes.
The network represents the joint probability distribution over all variables..

Applications of Bayesian Networks:
● Medical Diagnosis: To infer the probability of diseases based on symptoms.
● Fault Diagnosis: In complex systems like aircraft or nuclear plants. ● Decision Support
Systems: In finance and marketing for risk assessment and decision making.
● Gene Expression Analysis: In bioinformatics to understand the relationships between
genes.

EXAMPLE: Loan Risk Prediction.
Objective of This Experiment
To use a Bayesian Network to predict loan approval risk based on:
● Job Status (Stable/Unstable)
● Income Level (High/Low)
● Credit Score (Good/Poor)
● Loan Approval (Yes/No)

Explanation of Edges:
1. JobStatus → CreditScore:
A stable job increases the likelihood of a good credit score.
2. Income → CreditScore:
Higher income improves the chance of a good credit score.
3. CreditScore → LoanApproval:
A better credit score increases the probability of loan approval.
