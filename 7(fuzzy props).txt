Fuzzy set theory extends classical set theory by allowing degrees of membership between 0 and 1.
In classical sets, an element either belongs (1) or does not (0).
In fuzzy sets, elements can partially belong to a set — e.g., 0.4, 0.7, etc.

2. Properties of Fuzzy Sets
Let µA(x) and µB(x) be the membership values of an element x in sets A and B.

| Property                  | Formula               | Meaning                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Union (A ∪ B)**         | max(µA(x), µB(x))     | Combines two sets by taking the maximum membership. |
| **Intersection (A ∩ B)**  | min(µA(x), µB(x))     | Finds the common part of both sets.                 |
| **Complement (A′)**       | 1 − µA(x)             | Represents everything not in set A.                 |
| **Scalar Multiplication** | k × µA(x)             | Scales membership values (0 < k ≤ 1).               |
| **Fuzzy Sum (A + B)**     | min(1, µA(x) + µB(x)) | Adds membership degrees, capped at 1.               |

3. Fuzzification
Process of converting crisp inputs into fuzzy values using membership functions.
Example (Temperature = 25°C):
Cold → 0.0
Warm → 0.5
Hot → 0.25

4. Rule Base Example
IF Temperature is Cold → Fan Speed is Low
IF Temperature is Warm → Fan Speed is Medium
IF Temperature is Hot → Fan Speed is High

5. Defuzzification
Converts fuzzy output into a crisp value (e.g., fan speed).
Common method: Centroid Method
