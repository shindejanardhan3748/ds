Theory:

A cognitive-based application is designed to imitate the way humans think, learn, and understand information. It combines artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, and data processing to acquire and interpret knowledge from various sources, such as text, speech, or images. In this experiment, the focus is on acquiring knowledge through images, which represents visual cognition â€” a process similar to how the human brain identifies and understands visual inputs.

The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model such as ResNet50, which is part of the convolutional neural network (CNN) family. CNNs are specifically designed to process image data by automatically detecting features like edges, textures, and shapes from raw pixels. The model is trained on a large dataset (ImageNet), containing millions of labeled images, which enables it to recognize thousands of objects.

When an image is given to the system, it passes through multiple layers of the network that extract and combine visual features to generate a prediction. The model then outputs the most likely object classes along with their confidence scores. This process mimics human visual perception, where the brain identifies objects by comparing them with previously learned experiences.

Cognitive applications like this are widely used in real-world domains such as healthcare (disease detection from scans), autonomous vehicles (object and pedestrian detection), security (face recognition), and digital assistants (image-based search). By integrating perception and reasoning, cognitive systems enable machines to learn from experience and make intelligent decisions without explicit programming.

Conclusion:

This experiment successfully demonstrates a simple cognitive vision system that acquires and interprets knowledge from images. Using the ResNet50 model, the application can accurately recognize objects and display meaningful predictions. It shows how AI and deep learning can mimic human perception, forming the basis of real-world cognitive applications such as image recognition, autonomous systems, and visual search engines.
